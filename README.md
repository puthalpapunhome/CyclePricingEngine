# CyclePricingEngine
Help to calculate price of the bi-cycle
Import the project into eclipse by below git uri. https://github.com/puthalpapunhome/CyclePricingEngine.git

Add "/TestCycle/request.json" file from project into your system into the path of "C:\cycleApi\request.json" The above json file is contains of 48 json request with differenet components and corresponding dates.

Add "/TestCycle/test.json" file from project into your system into the path of "C:\cycleApi\test.json" The above json file is contains of high level and low level components and corresponding prices of them along with date period.

Run the "/TestCycle/src/com/cycleAPI/Mains/Test.java" in the project.

So we can get the total values of requested cycles according to the the diffrent type of components.

I used blocking queue using a maximum of 10 threads.

Hope you'll like the code structure and logic behind calculating price.

Thanks, Papun Puthal
